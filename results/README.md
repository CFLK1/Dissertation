Supplementary results for CFLK1's Dissertation.\
Note that some hyperparameters have different names from the final presented version.\
Just in case of confusion:

Ontology constraints:\
[HType]\
H1 = H+T\
H2 = H+TI\
H3 = H+TID\
H4 = H+TIDF

Relation normalisation:\
[ABType]\
A = False, no normalisation\
B = True, normalisation in place

Learning rate:\
[learnFac]\
10 = 0.1\
100 = 0.01\
1000 = 0.001

Magnitude:\
[constr]\
fixed = surface\
max = space

Method:\
[LType]\
L0 = linear\
L1 = hybrid\
L2 = projection

Margin and Dimension remain the same.
